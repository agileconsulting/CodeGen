CodeGen
=======

Generate code with Velocity template starting from a meta data source
I want give a new perpsective to software code generation.
Usually is the developer pespective "give me a tool to create code".
But code is not the only artifact, we must mantain also customer documentation, test plan
and a lot of boring artifact.
As a project manager i waste time in maintain all documentation in sync.
So the idea behind is a meta repository (Es. excel file) maintained from a business analyst.
From this repository this sofware will create all documents (yes code too but not only code).
After that, a coder can complete the work and the business analyst too.
So project manager can have more time for his real work
